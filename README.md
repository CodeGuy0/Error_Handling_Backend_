# Practice_Middlewares_(Backend)

# Overview

This repository contains my practice and exploration of middlewares in backend <br>
development, particularly using Express.js. Through this chapter, I gained an <br>
understanding of the following concepts:

# Topics Covered

-> What are Middlewares: Understanding the core concept and purpose of middlewares in a backend application. <br>

-> Using next(): How to chain middlewares effectively using the next() function. <br>

-> Creating Utility Middleware: Building reusable middleware functions for common tasks. <br>

-> Exploring app.use(): Understanding how to use app.use() to apply middleware globally or to specific routes. <br>

-> API Token as Query String: Implementing middleware to validate API tokens passed as query strings. <br>

-> Passing Multiple Middlewares: Chaining multiple middleware functions for enhanced functionality. <br>

-> Error Handling: Leveraging Express's default error-handling mechanisms to manage errors efficiently. <br>

# Practical Implementation

For each topic, I practiced writing and testing the corresponding code examples <br> to reinforce my learning.

# Key Learnings

-> The importance of middleware in backend application flow. <br>

-> How to structure middlewares for better code reusability and maintainability. <br>

-> Error-handling strategies to provide a better developer experience. <br>

# Future Scope

-> Explore third-party middleware libraries. <br>

-> Implement middlewares for logging and monitoring. <br>

-> Practice advanced error-handling scenarios.<br>
